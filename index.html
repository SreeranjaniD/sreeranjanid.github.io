    <b> A group of friends Rose, Dennis, Robert and Melissa, have just finished high school at James Madison Memorial High School and are trying to pick universities based on their ambitions. Robert and Dennis argue that they should consider colleges based on the region where it pays the best. Melissa gets the Wall Street Journal survey conducted by PayScale Inc. and they visualize salaries by region. From the visualization, Dennis says he will go to a college in California no matter what the major is.
